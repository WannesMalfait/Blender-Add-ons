- Editor: auto-closing parens/braces/quotes
- Editor: show other suggestions
- Editor: update visuals
- Deduplication of formula history
- Add CI for running tests

v2.0.0-alpha.4
- Simple tests to detect regressions quicker.
- Add support for loops
- Add support for keyword arguments
- Add a wiki, and update documentation
- Improve "arrange from root" operator (#20)
- Fix bug with default values for geometry sockets

v2.0.0-alpha.3
- Add some basic SDF's to included node groups.
- Editor: better handling of indentation.
- Editor: replace tabs with spaces on paste.
- Generate node information from version of blender the add-on is being run in.
- Reuse created node groups in the same formula.
- Fix bug with adding newlines.
- Fix problems with API changes in 4.0
- Fix problem with methods on numbers (like `5.sin()`)

v2.0.0-alpha.2
- Add support for adding functions using the `fn` keyword.
- Add support for adding node groups using the `ng` keyword.
- Add support for custom implementations. For example, the function `acosh()` is now well-defined.
- Fix bug with names with spaces
- Fix bug with autocomplete

v2.0.0-alpha.1
- Add autocompletion by pressing tab
- Fix bug with formulas like `5.sin()`

v2.0.0-alpha
- Complete rewrite to add support for the new fields system. Main changes include:
- Typechecking to overload functions (e.g. math vs vector math)
- Support to add basically all blender nodes, not just math nodes
- Better editor and error messages

v1.2.2
- Fix a bug with attribute separate XYZ.
v1.2.1
- Fix vector math `fract` not working.
- Fix separate xyz with one component always returning `x`.

v1.2.0
- Update positioning algorithm to work better with multiple outputs.
- Add support for the new vector math functions: 'Refract' and 'Faceforward'.
- Only check if it's a function if the next char is a '('. This allows attributes and functions
  with the same name.
- Add functions to select nodes connected to a root.
    - 'CTRL+E': Select children
    - 'SHIFT+E': Select parents 
    - 'CTRL+SHIFT+E': Select children and parents
- Missing arguments for non attribute nodes are just replaced with the default value of that node
  socket now, instead of 0.
- Clamp, Map Range Smoothstep and Smootherstep can now be used for normal math nodes (so not the attribute math versions)

v1.1.0
- Python constants can now be called without parentheses. This means that '!pi' is now valid.
  To indicate what is part of the python expression, parentheses should still be used. If you
  want the value pi/4, you should do '!(pi/4)' instead of '!pi/4', which would add a divide node.
- Calling functions with multiple values is now valid for binary functions (2 arguments). This 
  means that 'max(x,y,z)' is now valid. In addition to this, missing arguments are replaced with
  0 for math functions and with the string in the missing argument name property in the side panel
  for attribute math functions. 
- Font size can now be changed while editing the formula by using the scroll wheel.
- Syntax coloring now works for operators as well.
